        "Python OOPs questions And Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tWhat is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :-\tOOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and methods. It emphasizes concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.\tWhat is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :-\tA class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the created objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.\tWhat is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :-\n",
        "\tAn object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with attributes and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.\tWhat is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :-\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tAbstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tEncapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.\tWhat are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tDunder (double underscore) methods are special methods in Python, such as __init__(), __str__(), and __repr__(). They allow objects to implement behavior for built-in operations like initialization and string representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.\tExplain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tInheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits is called the child class or subclass, and the class from which it inherits is called the parent class or superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.\tWhat is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tPolymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same function to behave differently based on the object calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.\tHow is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tEncapsulation is achieved by declaring variables as private (prefixing with __) and providing getter and setter methods to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.\tWhat is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- A constructor is a special method, __init__(), that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.\tWhat are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :-\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tClass methods are methods that take the class itself as the first argument (usually cls) and are defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tStatic methods do not take any special first argument and are defined using the @staticmethod decorator. They don't access or modify the class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.\tWhat is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tMethod overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different arguments. Python doesn't support method overloading explicitly, but it can be simulated by using default arguments or variable-length arguments (*args).\n",
        "\n",
        "12.\tWhat is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tMethod overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.\tWhat is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tThe @property decorator is used to define a method as a property, allowing you to access it like an attribute. It is typically used for getter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.\tWhy is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tPolymorphism allows different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, making code more flexible and extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.\tWhat is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tAn abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is typically used as a blueprint for other classes. It can have abstract methods that must be implemented in derived classes. In Python, abstract classes are defined using the ABC module and @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.\tWhat are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :-\n",
        "o\tThe advantages of OOP include:\n",
        "\n",
        "\tModularity: Breaking the program into objects allows modular development.\n",
        "\n",
        "\tCode reusability: Inheritance promotes code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "\tFlexibility: Polymorphism and encapsulation increase flexibility and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\tData security: Encapsulation helps protect sensitive data.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.\tWhat is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tClass variables are shared among all instances of a class, while instance variables are unique to each object instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.\tWhat is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tMultiple inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one base class. This allows a derived class to inherit properties and methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.\tExplain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \t__str__() provides a readable and user-friendly representation of an object, whereas __repr__() provides a more technical or official string representation for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.\tWhat is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tsuper() is used to call the parent class's methods and constructor. It allows you to access inherited methods that have been overridden in a subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.\tWhat is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tThe __del__() method is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed to free up resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.\tWhat is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \t@staticmethod defines a method that does not receive the class or instance as the first argument, whereas @classmethod receives the class as the first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.\tHow does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tPolymorphism in Python allows the same method to behave differently in different classes. Through inheritance, a child class can override a method of the parent class, and depending on the object calling the method, it will execute the corresponding version.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.\tWhat is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :- \tMethod chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line. This is typically achieved by having each method return self.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.\tWhat is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans :-\n",
        "\tThe __call__() method allows an object to be called as if it were a function. It is useful for creating callable objects.\n"
